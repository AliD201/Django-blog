Also, for the app multiple branches might be created in order to seperate different concepts.
Current plan is to develop the following:
1- API
2- Access managment 
3- SSO &/or remote user role invokation 
   
Current progress 12/16 officially done*  


So far: 
* django have an embedded session managment 
* embedded sql lite database with a decent gui for the admin
* functional views
* class views 
* forms and automatic validation 
* apps/components 
* signals where each database change can activate a signal
* Paginator ( displaying posts in pages)
* Adding email password recovery through the ( resset-done-confirm-complete) chain
